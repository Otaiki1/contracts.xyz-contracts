# AgreementContract

## Overview

The AgreementContract is a Solidity smart contract that facilitates the creation and management of agreements between parties, where each agreement is associated with Soul Bound NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) that represent the agreement. These NFTs can contain metadata that is linked to the agreement details.

## Features

- Creation of agreements between parties.
- Signing of agreements by the involved parties.
- Minting of Soul Bound NFTs associated with signed agreements.
- Retrieval of agreement details and associated NFTs.
- Separate tracking of agreements initiated by each party.
- Ownership control to set the NFT contract address.

## Technologies Used

This smart contract is developed using the Ethereum blockchain and leverages the following technologies:

- **Solidity**: The contract is written in Solidity, the programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.

- **OpenZeppelin Contracts**: OpenZeppelin is a widely-used library for secure smart contract development. This contract uses OpenZeppelin's ERC721URIStorage for NFT functionality and Ownable for access control.

- **Counters**: The Counters library is used for counting and managing token IDs.

- **Polygon**: The contract is deployed on the Polygon blockchain, utilizing its distributed ledger and smart contract capabilities.

## Usage

1. **Creating an Agreement**:
   - To create a new agreement, parties call the `createAgreement` function, specifying the address of the second party and the desired metadata URI for the associated NFT.

2. **Signing the Agreement**:
   - The first party signs the agreement using the `party1SignAgreement` function.
   - The second party signs the agreement using the `party2SignAgreement` function.

3. **Minting the Soul Bound NFT**:
   - Once both parties have signed the agreement, either party can mint the associated Soul Bound NFT using the `mintNFTAgreement` function.

4. **Retrieving Agreement Details and NFTs**:
   - Parties can retrieve agreement details using the `getAgreementDetails` function.
   - Parties can also retrieve their initiated and received agreements using `getParty1Agreements` and `getParty2Agreements`, respectively.

5. **Setting the NFT Contract Address**:
   - The owner can set the address of the NFT contract using the `setNFTAddress` function.
